    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through the steps of how variants coming from a VCF can be annotated efficiently and thoroughly using the package variantannotation. In particular, the package is aimed at providing a way of retrieving variant information using [ANNOVAR](http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/) and [myvariant.info](myvariant.info) and consolidating it in conveninent formats. It is well-suited for bioinformaticians interested in aggregating variant information into a single database for ease of use and to provide higher analysis capabities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregation is performed specifically by structuring the data in lists of python dictionaries, with each variant being described by a multi-level dictionary. The choice was made due to the inconsistencies that exist between data availability, and the necessity to store their information in a flexible manner. Further, this specific format permits its parsing to a MongoDb instance (dictionaries are the python representation of JSON objects), which enables the user to efficiently store, query and filter such data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the package also has the added functionality to create csv and vcf files from MongoDB. The class Filters allows the user to rapidly query data that meets certain criteria as a list of documents, and the class FileWriter can transform such list into more widely accepted formats such as vcf and csv files. It should be noted that here, the main differential the package offers is the ability to write these files preserving all the annotation data. In the vcf files, for instance, outputs will have a 'Otherinfo' column where all the data coming from ANNOVAR and myvariant.info is condensed (while still preserving its structure). For vcf files, outputs will have around ~120-200 columns, depending on the amount of variant data that can be retrieved from myvvariant.info. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes on required software**\n",
    "\n",
    "the following libraries will be install upon installing variantannotation:\n",
    "- myvariant\n",
    "- pysam\n",
    "- pymongo\n",
    "- pyvcf\n",
    "\n",
    "Other libraries that are needed, but should natively e installed on most OS: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Watchdog\n",
    "- Pandas\n",
    "- Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, a MongoDB database must be set up. Refer to the documentation page for more information. \n",
    "Similarly, ANNOVAR must be downloaded, alongside with its supporting databases (also listed on the documentation page)."
