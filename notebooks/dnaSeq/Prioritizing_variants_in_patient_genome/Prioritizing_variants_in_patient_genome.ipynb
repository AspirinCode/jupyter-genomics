    "The first step in this tree is to determine whether the subject's ethnicity is known.  This is because we are only interested in rare variants (on the theory that most people aren't sick, so a variant that makes you sick must *ipso facto* be rare) but different ethnic groups have different allele frequencies.  Therefore, if we know the subject's ethnicity, it seems logical to compare it to allele frequencies for that ethnicity; if not, using the combined population of all ethnicities is probably the best bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next decision point looks at the maximum of all the relevent (as defined above) allele frequencies (from 1000 Genomes, Exome Sequencing Project, etc) and discards any variant whose maximum allele frequency across all those is not less than 0.05--e.g., 5%.  Subsequently, any variants with a listing in the genomicSuperDups table (e.g., likely to occur in a segmental duplication) are also discarded; this is because the ANNOVAR documentation at http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/region/ states \"Genetic variants that are mapped to segmental duplications are most likely sequence alignment errors and should be treated with extreme caution. Sometimes they manifest as SNPs with high fold coverage and probably high confidence score, but they may actually represent two non-polymorphic sites in the genomes that happen to have the same flanking sequence.”\n",

    "Remaining variants are checked for whether they have any known annotations in human disease (according to GWAS studies, ClinVar, COSMIC, or NCI-60) and, if so, routed straight to the top-tier results set; if not, we determine whether they are exonic.  Exonic variants that are likely to disrupt or truncate the protein go into the top-tier bin, those that are likely to cause other protein mutations go mostly into either the Tier 2 or Tier 3 bins, depending on how likely the mutations are to be deleterious.  Variants that are synonymous SNVs, variants of unknown function, or nonsynonymous SNVs that are nonetheless not predicted to be deleterious by any of the listed classifiers are further triaged (note that VEST3 is not included in the classifier list, as I don't know anything about it or its outputs, and BOTH polyphen predictions ARE included although I think probably only one is relevant because I don't know WHICH is relevant for any given study ... these are issues I'd like to address in the future.)  \n",

Variants not categorized as exonic but as \"exonic;splicing\" are likewise assessed by their various classifier calls and CADD phred score in the same way as the exonic variants, on the grounds that disrupting splicing is also a change likely to cause protein disruptions or mutations.\n",

    "Variants that are not exonic or splicing are assessed for possible regulatory disruption.  All variants called as \"ncRNA_exonic\", \"ncRNA_splicing\", or \"ncRNA_exonic;splicing\" go straight into Tier 3, as do those that fall in 3' UTRs and are in miRNA binding sites as predicted by TargetScanS, and those that are upstream of genes and are located in transcription factor binding sites as predicted by the Transfac Matrix Database.

I also see that NOTHING passes either of the CADD phred filters ... perhaps top 0.1% is too strict?  (Confusingly, I also see a lot of variants that have the \".\" of a \"NA\" for their CADD scores--both raw and phred--which confuses me as I thought CADD was supposed to be calculated for all possible variants?  I need to suss this out later.)  Finally, I see that the question of sample ethnicity (and thus what set of allele frequencies should be interrogated) is really a different sort of decision than the rest ... all the others are decisions made per variant, but that one is a decision at the level of the sample all the variants come from and determines what kind of information will be used in the per-variant decisions."

I also make the drug/disease associations a last-ditch triage step rather than the highest priority step, so that anything that has a drug or disease association will never be discarded but also won't overwhelm more immediately relevant variants."

    "This decision tree produces more reasonable results: generally smaller populations in higher tiers, widening out to larger sets at lower tiers.  The bottom tier (Tier 6) still has, in my opinion, too many items in it, and again most of those (2425 out of 2729) are simply variants with an NCI-60 allele frequency assigned to them (*any* NCI-60 allele frequency).  But  I don't anticipate looking at those anyway, and since I kept track of the path through the tree for each variant, I could filter them out later if I actually did have reason to examine that tier."

    "I think version 4 is a solid, defensible decision tree based on the information we currently have, but there are several points I'd like to improve.  There are a few pieces of info we currently have that I feel are not being used adequately:\n",
    "* **Conservation metrics**: This decision tree doesn't use PhyloP, SiPhy, or GERP++ values based on conservation of sequence at all.  I'd like to learn more about those and figure out where in the tree they could add value; my guess would be they might be able to sieve out some potentially meaningful variants that aren't exonic/splicing/ncRNA, which currently are mostly ignored.  It is perhaps worth noting that ANNOVAR can also annotate conserved genomic regions (unlike the scores above, which are at the level of conserved *bases*) from phastCons.\n",
    "* **NCI-60 allele frequency**: Conversely, as discussed above, I feel this tree may be using the NCI-60 allele frequencies too strongly.  Can we be more sensible about them, to avoid having them take over Tier 6?  Or should they have their own tier?\n",
    "\n",
    "I also think we there's additional information we don't have that would make the tree better, possibly including:  \n",
    "* **Chromatin marks**: If a variant fell in a region known to be an active promotor or enhancer, we'd probably upgrade it to Tier 5; if it fell into a known repressed region, we might want to discard or down-grade it even if it met the criteria for a tier above discard.  I'm not sure that knowing that a variant fell in an active elongation region would affect our decision-making.  Apparently we can get this info from ENCODE into ANNOVAR, but there is a caveat that \"although UCSC may provide more ENCODE annotations for hg19 in the future, at least at end of 2013 rich annotation is only available for hg18. The examples below all used hg18. If you are interested to annotate your hg19 variants, some of these databases may not be available\" (http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/region/#identify-variants-in-encode-annotated-regions ), which could be a problem if it is still applicable.  Another source might be Manolis Kellis' HaploReg database, which apparently includes chromatin information for many different tissue types, perhaps making it more relevant ... but I don't know if it is importable into ANNOVAR ...\n",
    "* **DNA accessibility**: The Semel Institute protocol states that \"conservation is a poor predictor of functional regulatory variation itself, whereas it can accurately trace a protein-DNA binding event when considered in combination with nucleotide-level DNA accessibility\".  Knowing that a variant fell in an accessible region, combined with use of the conservation metrics (see above) could justify pulling something out of Tier 6 or the Discard pile and putting it into ... a new tier?  The ANNOVAR documentation mentions that ENCODE provides Genome Browser tracks for DNase1 hypersensitivity that can be used in ANNOVAR.\n",
    "* **tRNA rate**: Knowing that a synonymous SNV strongly affected tRNA rate (either upwards or downwards) would probably put it into Tier 5 rather than Tier 6.  Although we probably can't know the actual change in tRNA rate due to a synonymous mutation, we *could* calculate whether the created codon is more or less rare than the original and by how much (since rare codons are usually slower).\n",
    "* **RNA stability**: Knowing that a synonymous SNV (or ncRNA\\_\\* variant) is very destabilizing would probably put it into Tier 5 rather than Tier 6. However, basic googling doesn't inform me of any large-scale databases of this information, and it isn't something calculable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I think there's some information that we are currently getting that we don't need, and could take out to speed up the ANNOVAR processing/reduce the size of the output:\n",
    "* **cytoBand**: Not currently being used (should it be?)\n",
    "* **cg46** and **cg69**: According to the ANNOVAR documentation at http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/user-guide/filter/, \"Each technical platform, such as Complete Genomics and Illumina HiSeq, may generate some platform specific sequencing artifacts. Complete genomics provides whole-genome data for a relatively small group of healthy subjects, but this data set can be quite useful to filter out technical artifacts for CG users.\"  Since we're not working with Complete Genomics data, perhaps these aren't very relevant?\n",
    "* **esp6500siv2_all** and **1000g2014oct_all**: These databases' allele frequencies are are apparently also included in the output of popfreq_all_20150413, so we are getting them twice, which is clearly unnecessary."
